This work is related to experimentation with a 10 Degrees of Freedom Accelerometer with pressure sensor
and compass. For my [COMP444](https://www.athabascau.ca/syllabi/comp/comp444.html) final project. I am most
interested in the compass; however, the accelerometer may be incorporated as well.

The item is a [IMU 10 DOF ±16g 3 Axis Accelerometer ±2000 °/s Gyro/Magnetometer/Barometer](https://www.robotshop.com/ca/en/imu-10-dof-16g-3-axis-accelerometer-2000--s-gyromagnetometerbarometer-c.html) which was purchased from [RobotShop Canada Inc.](https://www.robotshop.com/ca/en/).
